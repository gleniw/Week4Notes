Prepare

- Check syntax

- Checks variables

- Translate to optimise code

Runtime

- Run the code

- Unexpected events



Compiler removes all previous built and replaces with the new one

Memory is managed with C#

C# is a little slower than C++ but is more consistent 

Copiler options for every language

#### C# and .NET

- Object Oreintated

- Type-Safe



###### Windows Specific

Avaliable languages all dealt with in the same platform



###### Frameworks

.NET 7 changes more performance based

#### Introduction to Visual Studio

Add terminal to the VS Tabs



#### C# Further Reading

Focus on
